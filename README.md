# Next.js Authentication App
This is a Next.js project that includes user login functionality with API integration, NextAuth.js for authentication, and JWT handling (including refresh tokens).

# Getting Started
First, install the dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install

You can start editing the page by modifying **app/page.tsx**. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Authentication Setup
This project integrates [NextAuth.js](https://authjs.dev/) for authentication with JWT and refresh token handling.

# Configuration
Create a **.env** file at the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables for NextAuth and JWT.

Configure NextAuth in your project to handle authentication and token management.

# API Routes
Define your protected API routes in the **app/api** directory and use NextAuth to secure these routes.

# Token Refresh Handling
To handle token refresh, implement the necessary logic in your NextAuth configuration. This typically involves storing a refresh token and using it to obtain a new access token when the current one expires.
